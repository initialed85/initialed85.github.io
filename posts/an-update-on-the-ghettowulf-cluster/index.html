They both touch the GPU… and they both use ffmpeg underneath- so probably the issue is ffmpeg. Side note.\nI tried to upgrade everything to be using later versions of ffmpeg, I failed miserably and decided it wasn’t worth my time; so what else can I do?\nWell a watchdog of course, what else! I slapped together a way to expose liveness and then made use of that with a livenessProbe ( not unlike a Docker Healthcheck) so now this too is something that has ceased to be a source of failures for me.\nSo what’s left? I’m not really sure what to do next- for sure there are outstanding things, like:\nGet the Prometheus metrics from the Kube API and the Node Exporter to be using a common label so that I can relate them together Change from Traefik to Nginx because it’s been nice using Traefik (the default with k3s) but frankly I’m an Nginx guy and I only have so many brain cells to dedicate to knowledge about reverse proxies Migrate Home Assistant from Docker to Kube I can’t even remember why I haven’t done this yet, I got stuck on something mundane and just sort of stopped putting time into it- might have been reverse proxy Host header related? Physically tidy up the shelf I think I can use a document stand like this to get the laptops to take up less footprint Give Ceph the disks currently owned by the the ZFS pool on the HP Microserver The Home Assistant migration is blocking this; also I should probably buy some external caddies so that I can distribute those drives across the cluster (rather than having a huge chunk of storage on a single node) Migrate dinosaur from Docker to Kubernetes This is non-trivial because its whole mechanism is enabled through orchestrating the creation of Docker containers Deploy my entry for the FTP Game Jame 2022 on the cluster More on this thing in the next post Honestly though, I dunno how much of that I’ll do- I’ve achieved the secondary goal of migrating (most of) my stuff to Kubernetes and in doing so I’ve achieved my primary goal of learning about Kubernetes; for sure I don’t know everything about it but I feel like I’ve been exposed to a reasonable chunk of the capability it provides and got a feel for some of the patterns, enough to BS my way through an interview for a job with it anyway!\n","wordCount":"994","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-20T15:49:42+08:00","dateModified":"2022-12-20T15:49:42+08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Edward Beech"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://initialed85.cc/posts/an-update-on-the-ghettowulf-cluster/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"initialed85's misc tech stuff","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://initialed85.cc/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://initialed85.cc/ accesskey=h title="initialed85's misc tech stuff (Alt + H)">initialed85's misc tech stuff</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>An update on the Ghettowulf Cluster</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-20 15:49:42 +0800 +0800'>December 20, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Edward Beech</div></header><div class=post-content><p>So it&rsquo;s been about 2 months since I last wrote about this thing and it had been running for a couple of weeks before I wrote about it, which
